# Project: FDA Data Analysis with MySQL

## Software/Tools:
- MySQL

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to perform data analysis on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) dataset provided by iVision. The dataset contains information on drug approvals, sponsors, marketing statuses, dosage forms, therapeutic evaluation codes, and approval trends. The analysis will be conducted using SQL queries in MySQL to derive insights and create informative reports.

## Tasks:

### Part 1: SQL Queries
**Task 1: Identifying Approval Trends**
1. Determine the number of drugs approved each year and provide insights into the yearly trends.
2. Identify the top three years with the highest and lowest approvals, in descending and ascending order, respectively.
3. Explore approval trends over the years based on sponsors.
4. Rank sponsors based on the total number of approvals they received each year between 1939 and 1960.

**Task 2: Segmentation Analysis Based on Drug MarketingStatus**
1. Group products based on MarketingStatus. Provide meaningful insights into the segmentation patterns.
2. Calculate the total number of applications for each MarketingStatus year-wise after the year 2010.
3. Identify the top MarketingStatus with the maximum number of applications and analyze its trend over time.

**Task 3: Analyzing Products**
1. Categorize Products by dosage form and analyze their distribution.
2. Calculate the total number of approvals for each dosage form and identify the most successful forms.
3. Investigate yearly trends related to successful forms.

**Task 4: Exploring Therapeutic Classes and Approval Trends**
1. Analyze drug approvals based on therapeutic evaluation code (TE_Code).
2. Determine the therapeutic evaluation code (TE_Code) with the highest number of Approvals in each year.

## Conclusion:
This project aims to leverage the powerful data analysis capabilities of MySQL to derive insights from the FDA dataset. By executing SQL queries, we aim to uncover trends, patterns, and valuable information to support decision-making processes and provide meaningful insights to stakeholders.
